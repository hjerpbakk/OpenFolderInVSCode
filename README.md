# OpenFolderInVSCode

When working on many simultaneous projects with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), it is convenient having a fast way of opening the project folders. With the *open from the terminal* shell extension, and this service, your project folders can be opened from both the Terminal and the Finder.

1. Install the [Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) in VS Code.
2. Download the Automator service from [this repository](https://github.com/Sankra/OpenFolderInVSCode). This is a macOS service which opens a given folder from the Finder in VS Code.
3. Open the service and choose *Install*.

That's it! Now all you have to do is right clicking on a folder and choose the *Open in Visual Studio Code* service and your folder will open as a project in VS Code.
